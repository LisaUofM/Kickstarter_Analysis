# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Excel data analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns (for Louise)

**The Analysis**: The Kickstarter campaign data is organized across nine excel tabs: (1)Category Statistics, (2)Subcategory Statistics, (3)Outcomes Based on Launch Date, (4)Edinburgh Research, (5)Successful US Kickstarters, (6)Failed US Kickstarters, (7)Descriptive Statistics (8)Box Plots and the data extract of Kickstarter campaigns used for this analysis. Read below for summary findings of each tab and recommendations based on the analysis. 
(1)A look at campagins by category (industry) and outcomes: successful, live, failed and canceled. The theater category had the highest number of campaigns: 1651 of 3038, but proportionately not the highest count of successful campaigns: 525/912 (58%). Music had the highest proportionate count of successful campaigns: 490/636 (77%)
(2) A closer look at outcomes exclusively for the theater subcategory: musicals, plays and spaces, with plays being the dominant subcategory at 314 campaigns of the 359 total campaigns for that category
(3) A line graph demonstrated outcomes by launch date, highlighting May, June and July as the highest-performing months for starting a campaign
(4) Metrics on Louise's five favorite plays performed in Great Britain, includng goal and pledge amounts, average donations and number of backers. If judged by pledge amount % above goal amount, the play "Cutting off Kate Bush" was the most successful, bringing in 172% of it's goal amount. 
(5)A table view of all 413 successful theater campaigns and associated metrics.
(6)A table view of all 251 failed theater campaigns and associated metrics.
(7) Descriptive statistics that capture measures of central tendency (mean, median) and measures of spread (SD, Upper Quartile, Lower Quartile and IQR) of successful and failed theater campaigns
(8) A box plot visual of the descriptive statistics (mean, median, SD, Upper Quartile, Lower Quartile and IQR) of campaigns for musicals in Great Britain. All out comes are included in this data set. 
(9) The raw data extract used for the analysis. 

**Recommendations**: For a successful theater/play campaign, based on findings in tab 3, we recommend the launch date occur in May, June or July; based on tab 7, we recommend Louise's campaign goal amount be between the median (3,000) and the mean (5,049) goals calculated for successful goals. The IQR, which captures a data point furthest away from the mean while capturing 50% of the data, is $3,500, which is healthily between the range we recommend. (Note the IQR of the pledged data is $3,982). While a few very large goals (and pledges) have skewed the mean and standard deviations of the data, we wouldn't recommend it as a target goal, but as an upper bound to estimating the target goal. The mean of the goal amount and pledge amount is close to the Upper Quartile amounts, which further supports the use of the mean as an upper bound for estimation. 
For a successful production in Great Britain, based on findings tab 4, we recommend reviewing the success of "Cutting off Kate Bush" to better understand the pledge returns and to imitate its success in Great Britain; based on the box plot visual in tab 8, we recommend noting the outliers - dots that represent high dollar amounts that skew the mean data. For estimating campaign goals in Great Britain, we further recommend noting the boxes, which represent the IQR of goals (blue box) and pledges (orange box); each box shows how the data is spread around the median (the line inside each box). Based simply on pledges, we recommend goal amounts be between the lower and upper quartile.
